This site was built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The purpose of this project was to spin up a personal website where I could host links to all my contact info, resume, Github etc., however it was also to get more familiar with Next.js.

Since making this site I have built a few other personal projects with Next.js for the sake of practicing and learning and perhaps once those are polished up a bit they will make an appearance here as well!
